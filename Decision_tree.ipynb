        "### Question 1: What is a Decision Tree, and how does it work in the context of classification?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that is mainly used for classification and regression tasks. In classification, it helps predict the category or class of a data point based on input features.\n",
        "\n",
        "The structure of a decision tree is similar to a flowchart. It starts at the top with a root node, which represents the entire dataset. From there, the data is split into branches using decision rules based on feature values. Each split leads to a new internal node or a leaf node, which holds the final prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "1. The algorithm looks for the feature that best divides the data into classes.\n",
        "2. It uses metrics like Gini Impurity or Information Gain to determine the best splits.\n",
        "3. This process continues recursively, creating new branches until stopping criteria are met (like maximum depth or pure leaves).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Suppose we want to classify whether a person will buy a product or not based on their age and income. The tree might first split by age (>30 or <=30), then by income level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion: Decision Trees are easy to understand and interpret. They mimic human decision-making, making them popular in business and educational settings."

        "### Question 2: Explain the concepts of Gini Impurity and Entropy as impurity measures. How do they impact the splits in a Decision Tree?\n",
        "\n",
        "In a decision tree, Gini Impurity and Entropy are used to measure how mixed the classes are in a dataset. These help the algorithm decide where to split the data for the best classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Gini Impurity:\n",
        "Measures the probability of wrongly classifying a randomly chosen element.\n",
        "Formula: Gini = 1 - Σ(p_i^2), where p_i is the probability of class i.\n",
        "A Gini value of 0 means perfect classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Entropy:\n",
        "- Comes from information theory. Measures disorder or uncertainty.\n",
        "- Formula: Entropy = -Σ(p_i * log2(p_i))\n",
        "- Entropy is highest when classes are equally mixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact on Splits:\n",
        "- The decision tree selects the feature and threshold that results in the greatest reduction in impurity (either Gini or Entropy).\n",
        "- This helps create pure child nodes where samples mostly belong to one class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If a node has 10 class A and 10 class B samples, impurity is high. A good split will create child nodes like one with 9A, 1B and another with 1A, 9B."

        "Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping):\n",
        "- Stops the tree from growing too large during training.\n",
        "- It uses rules like max_depth, min_samples_split, or min_samples_leaf to limit growth.\n",

        "Advantage:\n",
        "- Faster training time since it avoids building a large tree unnecessarily.\n",

        "- First builds a full tree, then removes branches that do not improve accuracy.\n",
        "- Also called cost-complexity pruning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantage:\n",
        "- Leads to a more accurate and generalized model, since pruning is done after seeing the full data.\n",
