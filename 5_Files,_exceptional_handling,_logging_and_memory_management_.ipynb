        "Ans: Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during program execution. It allows the program to continue running or fail gracefully instead of crashing. Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions. Code that might cause an error is placed inside the try block. If an error occurs, the except block handles it. The else block runs if no exception occurs, and the finally block executes no matter what, usually for cleanup tasks. This helps in building robust and user-friendly programs. For example, handling file errors or division by zero can prevent program crashes."

This ensures that essential cleanup code is always executed, even if an error is raised or the program is interrupted. For example, if a file is opened in the try block, it can be safely closed in the finally block to avoid resource leaks."

Python manages memory automatically through its built-in mechanisms, but understanding how it works can help developers write more efficient code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects of Python memory management include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Automatic Memory Allocation**:  \n",
        "   When objects are created, Python automatically allocates memory for them. The memory is dynamically managed based on the size and type of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reference Counting**:  \n",
        "   Python uses reference counting to keep track of how many references point to an object. When an object’s reference count reaches zero (i.e., no references are pointing to it), the memory is considered unused and can be deallocated.\n",

        "3. **Garbage Collection**:  \n",
        "   Python employs a garbage collector to detect and clean up circular references (objects that reference each other) which cannot be cleaned up by reference counting alone. The garbage collector periodically frees memory used by objects that are no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memory Pools (Pymalloc)**:  \n",

        "\n",
        "5. **Object Resizing**:  \n",

        "6. **Explicit Memory Management**:  \n",

It allows for cleaner, more organized code by separating the error-handling logic (in the except block) from the logic that should run when no errors occur.
