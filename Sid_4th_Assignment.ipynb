        "\n",
        "●\t🏆 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brings several key advantages that make software development more efficient, flexible, and manageable. By organizing code into classes and objects, OOP improves reusability, maintainability, and scalability of applications.\n",
        "✅ 1. Modularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tOOP breaks down a program into smaller, manageable parts (objects and classes).\n",
        "●\tEach class is like a module, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and test.\n",
        "●\tThis promotes separation of concerns (i.e., each class handles its own specific functionality).\n",
        "✅ 2. Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tThrough inheritance, you can reuse existing code (methods and properties) without having to rewrite it.\n",
        "●\tOnce a class is written and tested, it can be reused in different programs.\n",
        "●\tThis leads to less code duplication and saves time in future development.\n",
        "✅ 3. Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tPolymorphism allows you to use the same method name for different object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tYou can extend existing classes (using inheritance) without altering the original code, making it easy to introduce new features.\n",
        "●\tThis leads to flexible systems that can adapt to new requirements.\n",
        "✅ 4. Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tEncapsulation keeps the internal state of an object hidden and only exposes a public interface (via methods).\n",
        "●\tThis helps to protect data and ensures that an object’s internal state is not changed unexpectedly.\n",
        "●\tIt also makes it easier to debug since you can isolate issues within individual objects.\n",
        "✅ 5. Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tAbstraction hides complex details and shows only the necessary information.\n",
        "●\tIt allows programmers to interact with objects through simplified interfaces while hiding the implementation details.\n",
        "●\tThis leads to cleaner, more understandable code.\n",
        "✅ 6. Easier Maintenance and Modification:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tSince OOP encourages the use of modular code, it becomes easier to update and maintain.\n",
        "●\tChanges in one claslly don’t affect others, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\n",
        "●\tIt’s easy to add or modify features without affecting the whole system, making maintenance more efficient.\n",
        "✅ 7. Improved Productivity:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tOOP’s organization of code into classes and objects leads to better collaboration among teams of developers.\n",
        "●\tCode can be maintained and extended by different teams working on different modules independently.\n",
        "●\tCode libraries and frameworks often use OOP, giving developers access to tools that make development faster.\n",
        "✅ 8. Increased Security:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tOOP allows you to control access to data through getter and setter methods, which helps in protecting data integrity.\n",
        "●\tAccess modifiers (e.g., private, protected, public) help in restricting access to an object’s internal state and behavior, enhancing security.\n",
